    <div class="container content editable" id="untitled-region-1"><h2>We're a family business.</h2>
<p>In 1988 Raise the Roof Design And Construction was founded on two principles – quality and personal service. At RTR we specialize in quality residential remodeling and construction. We offer homeowners an unsurpassed array of construction and design services in such disciplines as architectural design, structural engineering, project management, site planning, interior design consultation and plan expediting. Whether you are considering adding a level, building an addition, or interior renovation, we have the experience and resources to do it all. Every project, large or small, will benefit from RTR’s years of professional experience.</p>
<p>Because we emphasize a coordinated team approach, RTR can take even the largest residential projects from concept through completion with remarkable efficiency and ease. With our name on each job site and our reputation on the line, we help coordinate all aspects of the construction process. This level of dedication guarantees that your home construction project is the highest quality, meets your expectations and delivers on schedule. Our phenomenal growth reflects this commitment to our customer’s satisfaction.</p>
<h3 class="divider">Our Strengths</h3>
<p><strong>QUALITY:</strong> In every element of construction, RTR adheres to the highest standards. From designing a project to selecting premium building materials, our exacting requirements and hard work enable us to deliver a superlative product.</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Since the company’s start more than 25 years ago we have enhanced and added value to many homes in Union County and New Jersey. Because of our longevity, we’ve been able to assemble a superior group of contractors, craftsmen, and suppliers. RTR utilizes this experienced team to ensure your new home fits your vision and your budget. Thanks to their talents our customers can expect a home building project of lasting value.</p>
<p><strong>VALUE:</strong> RTR is diligent about providing the best materials and workmanship at fair prices. We provide firm pricing; well in advance of construction our customers are aware of all costs. Before a contract is ever signed we obtain fixed prices for materials for customer approval. This up-front pricing policy has resulted in satisfied customers and word-of-mouth business.</p>
<p><strong>INTEGRITY:</strong> Upholding our reputation is RTR’s cornerstone. That’s why we are eager to provide customer, subcontractor and bank references to interested clients. We are proud of our record in the home construction industry and welcome the chance to share it.</p>
<p><strong>SERVICE:</strong> RTR uses a hands-on approach to create a home customized for your unique lifestyle. We have developed a large range of services to meet any need in a construction project and ensure the continuity of a single contact during the process. We take the sometimes intimidating process of construction and turn it into an enjoyable experience while staying on time and in budget.</p>
<h3 class="divider">The Process</h3>
<p>Whether you have plans of your own or just a general desire to change your home, the team at Raise The Roof can fine tune your ideas or listen to your needs and wishes and formulate a design that fits the way you live. This begins with our first meeting and continues throughout the project. We will help you create the scale, atmosphere and quality of living environment that best reflects and enhances your home. Our goal is to take the stress out of construction by beginning the process with a focused plan that balances your needs with a price that meets your budget.</p>
<p>Once we have identified these elements we will write a contract that details your project and the costs involved, with a description of the work to be done, the materials to be used and estimated start date and date of completion. Before the contract is signed we're happy to provide references, customers that you can call or homes that you can view for a sample of our work.</p>
<p>RTR will help you handle all the necessary government permits, regulations and inspections. Our long experience gives us the knowledge needed to navigate the governmental procedures and expedite the process.</p>
<p>Construction can be inconvenient but RTR keeps the time of construction to a minimum. Once we've decided on a start date we will be there on time, our teams will work seamlessly from one stage of the project to the next, until it is complete. Our simplified full-service approach means you will have the continuity of a single contact at every stage of the construction process. We pride ourselves in treating your home as we would our own and always make it a priority to keep the construction area as clean and safe as possible.</p>
<p><strong>We won’t leave the job site until you are satisfied. Just call RTR to begin the process.</strong></p></div><!--/content container-->

                <p>Raise the Roof came highly recommended by our friends.  They had worked three times with 
                Steve Paterno.</p>
                
                <p>We had some major damage from Hurricane Sandy. RTR replaced a third of our rafters / 
                roof / cedar siding shingles, etc.  Steve said it would take about 6 days and the project 
                came on schedule, as promised.</p>

                <p>Actually, painless.  So, like our friends, we also recommend RTR.</p>
